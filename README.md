### Implementation
*This was implemented entirely by prompting Qwen-2.5 Coder 32B Instruct MLX 4-bit running locally on my M4 Max macbook pro (48 GB ram), all inside of an hour, in late December 2024.  In total, maybe a handleful of prompts were used.*  The game is very much rough around the edges, but I'm putting it here as sort of a point-in-time landmark.  Everything was pretty easy to make happen.
